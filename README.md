### 🌟 Profile

I am an engineer focused on delivering **scalable backend services** and **production-ready Generative AI systems**. My experience centers on integrating LLMs into reliable applications, with a hands-on approach to **clean architecture, low latency,** and advanced **workflow orchestration** (RAG, multi-agent frameworks).

### 💡 Experience

Key capabilities I have built and delivered solutions around:

* **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Implemented adaptive AI backends using frameworks like **LangGraph** to manage sequential reasoning, generate personalized outputs, and automate feedback processes.
* **Conversational AI Systems:** Built end-to-end voice and text-based systems, incorporating **ASR, multi-turn LLM control, RAG-enhanced reasoning, and real-time TTS** for dynamic interactions (e.g., telephony-based screening tools).
* **Intelligent Data Pipelines:** Developed unified systems for data processing and value extraction, including building pipelines for **multilingual translation** and **OCR-enabled document retrieval** (search).
* **High-Performance Backend:** Established system scaling and reliability using modern Python frameworks (FastAPI) combined with efficient caching and concurrency mechanisms (**Redis**).

### 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Backend & Core:** Python (FastAPI, Django), PostgreSQL, MongoDB, **Redis**, Docker.
* **Generative AI:** **LangGraph**, LangChain, **RAG Systems**, Vector Databases (Qdrant), LLM Optimization.
* **Cloud & Tools:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Azure, Twilio, ElevenLabs, Heygen, KlingAI, Firebase, Shopfy, Wix, Wordpress.
